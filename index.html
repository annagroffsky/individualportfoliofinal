      <p>Hi! My name is Anna Groffsky and I am a junior in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I am pursuing a BS in Information with a focus in Social Media Analysis and Design and a sub focus in UX Design. Through relevant coursework and internships, I have acquired a combination of experiences in social media strategy and research tactics. I am passionate about the intersection between technology, marketing strategy and psychology. 
      Through this webpage, you will get to learn more about me. I am very proud of my work experience, extremely passionate about my extracurriculars, and very attached to places I've lived. I also love to travel, eat, and spend time with friends and family which you will get a glimpse of in my image gallery. Enjoy!</p>

      <h4>Research Assistant Intern</h4>
      <p>MSPICED is a summer internship program in which interns are placed in 1 of 4 labs and gain exposure to cutting-edge research. As interns, we conducted studies, did data analysis and helped recruit and schedule participants. We also had weekly meetings and reading groups to learn more about current psychological research. I was placed in the Social Minds Lab which studies how children develop a sense of cooperation, fairness, trust and teamwork. The image is my poster I presented at a symposium, exemplifying the research and preliminary results of the study I was placed on.</p>

      <div class="ma" tabindex="0">
      <h3>South Dartmouth, MA</h3>
      <p>My life began on the East Coast. My first home was in the small village of South Dartmouth, a short drive away from New Bedford. Although I only lived here for 4 months of my life, my family never sold our house, using it as a summer home. We would return for the last month of summer for years. South Dartmouth will forever be my favorite place to escape. With just a 5 minute walk to the beach and a 10 minute walk to the village center, you were never too far from paradise. </p>

      <h3>Edina, MN</h3>
      <p>After MA, my family moved to Edina, Minnesota for my dad's work. Although the Minnesota winters took some time to get used to, my family and I fell in love. The part I miss most about Edina is the nature, especially the lakes. In the land of 10,000 lakes, there is no shortage of trails to walk around or lakeside restaurants and ice cream shops.</p>

      <p>Moving away from home was scary, but in 3 short years, Ann Arbor has been able to feel like home. I love Ann Arbor so much that I decided to spend all spring and summer here too. Some favorite spots of mine include the League, Blank Slate Creamery, and of course, the Big House.</p>

      <p>This spring I will be moving to a new place. I have always wanted to study abroad and I am so excited to finally go spend a semester in Europe. I will be going through DIS Copenhagen, studying New Media and Changing Communities. As a huge fan of travelling (which I hope is apparent in the next section of my webpage), I cannot wait to see where this next semester takes me. To learn more about DIS, focus over the beautiful Copenhagen image!</p>
